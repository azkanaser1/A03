## How to use GitHub:
1. Create a new repository on GitHub
2. Give it a name and description
3. Add a README file
4. Make it public and select "Create repository"
5. Create a branch from the Code tab
6. Edit the file
7. Commit changes and include a commit message
8. Create pull request, including a description of changes
9. Merge your pull requests
10. Now you may delete the branch which was just merged into main

## Define:
- **repository**: similar to a folder that contains all of the project files, including documentation and edit history
- **README file**: a file containing information about a project, written in plain text Markdown language
- **branch**: parallel version of a repository that lets you have different versions of it at the same time, without distrupting the main/live one. A branch may be merged into main to publish changes
- **commits**: saved changes to a file
- **commit messages**: help others understand what you changed and why
- **pull request**: proposed changes to a repository / a request to merge which may be accepted or rejected by collaborators. Diffs (additions & subtractions) between the content of both branches are displayed in different colors. This feature is very useful for collaborations.
- **merging**: applies the change from one branch onto another (happens after a pull request) if there are no conflicting changes
